This is a Connect 4 AI that was designed to use minimaxing to make decision on
what moves to make next.
To run the project, type: python **init**.py

**init**.py:
The main file. When you run this, you will be able to select from the following
options multiple options of what to do.

Connect_4.py:
The code for the manual Connect 4 game. This checks for winners and displays
the connect 4 board in the terminal.

Heuristic.py:
This is the file where I implemented the different heuristics that are used by
the alpha beta algorithm.

Minimax.py:
This is the algorithm that chooses its next move based on the heuristic that
was used earlier. It is also where I implemented all Connect 4 games that
involved an AI player

Test.py:
A test file that is used to make sure all of the helper functions are working
as they should be.
